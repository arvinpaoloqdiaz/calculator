# Simple Calculator
This is a static webpage containing a simple calculator using purely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

There are two sections, the **Calculator** section, and the **History** section.

## Calculator Section
The Calculator section works just like a calculator with the exception of the ***percentage (%)*** operator. 

Usually, this is a percentage operation, but in this case, we use the % operator for modulo operations.

## History Section
The History section stores the expression as well as the answer when the ***equal (=)*** button is clicked. 

When the history section is clicked, the clicked expression will be called back to the screen and can be edited for another operation.

## Responsiveness
The whole webpage is responsive to small, medium, and large screens

This is possible through the use of ***@media*** queries.

When the screen is medium and large, the calculator and history sections are inline.

When the screen is small, the calculator is above the history section.

The container for the calculator also becomes transparent and when you click an expression in the history section, it will scroll up back to the calculator section.
